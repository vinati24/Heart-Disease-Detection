# Heart-Disease-Detection
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally, accounting for millions of fatalities each year. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical in managing the disease, improving patient outcomes, and reducing mortality rates. Traditionally, medical professionals have relied on clinical tests, expert opinions, and patient history to diagnose heart disease. However, with the advent of data-driven technologies, machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to assisting in the early detection and classification of heart disease.

The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate several machine learning models for the classification of heart disease. The goal is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on various clinical features, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.
